"# decision_tree_drug_prediction" 

Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X and Drug Y.

Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are the Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

It is a sample of a multiclass classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of an unknown patient or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.

Goal
Find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are the Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
